0,"On the Coronavirus, Pakistan’s Government Is Missing in Action","During a televised broadcast on March 22, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed his hesitancy in imposing a nationwide lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic, explaining that such a move would have devastating economic consequences for the poor. “Twenty five percent of Pakistanis are below the poverty line,” Khan said.  “Today if I impose a complete lockdown, then my country’s rickshaw drivers, pushcart vendors, taxi drivers, small shopkeepers, daily wage earners all of them will be shut in their homes. ”In Pakistan, where around 30 percent of the population lives in grave poverty, avoiding catching the coronavirus isn’t the only thing on people’s minds.  Staving off hunger often comes first. The coronavirus pandemic and the economic recession the International Monetary Fund predicts will follow it have imperiled the food security of many Pakistanis, and a broader economic collapse and escalating rates of unemployment would only add to the country’s poverty. Pakistan’s citizens are nevertheless coming together to tackle this pandemic the best way they know how—through the act of charity. Given that Pakistan is a state whose tenets are rooted in the Islamic faith, many of its citizens believe that the best way to combat this crisis is through the spirit of altruism. The government has launched its own initiatives, including the Ehsaas Program, which has been providing cash assistance of 12,000 rupees (approximately $75) to low-income families.  Within a few weeks, the government managed to disburse 55 billion rupees (about $344 million) to 4. 6 million families that registered for the program through a text-message service.  On April 1, Khan also set up a COVID-19 relief fund; the premier urged citizens via Twitter to donate funds to help those made destitute by the lockdown. 
Meanwhile, local volunteer organizations and ordinary citizens have been using WhatsApp and various social media platforms to make appeals for donations and food—especially essential grocery items including sugar, oil, flour, lentils, and tea, a list that nowadays also includes sanitizer, masks, and soap. The Human Development Foundation Pakistan, one of the oldest nonprofit development organizations based in the capital, Islamabad, has set out to support 5,000 impoverished families, according to the foundation’s CEO, Azhar Saleem.  So far, the organization has provided rations to approximately 14,000 people. Even ordinary citizens have stepped up to the plate, including Omair Shakil, a Pakistani physician and public health expert based in Boston.  Shakil told Foreign Policy that by leveraging the power of social media, he managed to raise over $12,000 within two weeks. The coronavirus pandemic has also underscored the strained relationship between the government and the Islamic establishment.  Unlike other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan has not yet imposed a complete ban on mosque sermons and religious gatherings for fear of retaliation from Islamist groups.  Clerics continue to refuse to obey Khan’s calls to limit prayer gatherings as thousands of people continue to pack mosques across the country. Afwan, a painter who asked to only use his first name, attended a crowded Friday sermon in Karachi last week, explained to me the clerical establishment’s motives: “This unprecedented time is a sign from God that the world has sinned.  I don’t understand why the government is trying to halt mosque gatherings, when it’s clearly the time for all Muslims to come together in larger groups to atone for our sins. ”Confronting such logic—and getting religious leaders to encourage safe behavior among their followers, as clerics in many other countries have done—will not be easy.  But Khan must take the bold step of fully implementing a temporary shutdown of all mosques and other religious gatherings during the month of Ramadan to prevent a larger outbreak. Pakistan is currently tackling one of its biggest challenges since independence.  The coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures have devastated the lives of the country’s most vulnerable citizens.  Pakistan does not have sufficient resources and funding to tackle the devastation caused by the lockdown. However, there are ways through which the government can prevent the country from going into a complete state of emergency. There is an urgent need on the part of the Khan administration, which has so far shown limited involvement with aid programs, to facilitate and support community efforts to ensure that no family is left to go hungry.  More funding must be directed toward procuring protective gear and tests for health care facilities and coronavirus management centers.  Such measures will aid in Pakistan’s fight to contain the virus and prevent an economic fallout when lockdown is eventually lifted. For now, the country is surviving purely on its citizens’ willingness to give. He then proceeded to work with vetted organizations and individuals to distribute cash, ration bags, and personal protective equipment to public and private hospitals in need. But despite their best intentions, community relief efforts and government schemes such as the Ehsaas Programme and the COVID-19 relief fund will have limited results. Reports from those working on the ground indicate that most food and medical aid distribution has been limited to areas near major cities, depriving those living in rural areas.  The latter, whose workers make up most of Pakistan’s informal sector and are dependent on daily wages, are more likely to be affected by the stringent lockdown measures. Further, cash assistance programs like Ehsaas can become vectors of disease transmission, because they require in-person interactions.  As Shakil noted, “The requirement for beneficiaries to collect their allotted monies from cash distribution centers carries the risk of community spread of the very disease that the program is meant to curb. ”Moreover, Ehsaas, which only provides monetary assistance to those who register via text message, is not particularly user-friendly, given that many rural families do not own smartphones and don’t always know how to claim the relevant benefits.  Such programs only cater to people who can read and understand text messages written in Urdu. In most regions of the country, Urdu is not the first language and Pakistan’s low literacy rate of 58 percent means that, without assistance, many non-Urdu readers will be unable to access the benefits of Ehsaas. “Overall, community organization efforts can only work if citizens and NGOs have the support of the local administration,” argued Ahsan J.  Pirzada, a lawyer who—by his count—raised over 7 million rupees ($44,000) through various online platforms and has been delivering ration packets to marginalized groups in Pakistan, including Christians, the transgender community, and slum-dwellers. “The government could at the very least pass an ordinance which makes it easy for community organizations and citizens like me to register and open a bank account where people can donate,” Pirzada said. While community relief efforts have provided temporary relief to the poor, they may not be a sustainable option given the protracted length of this pandemic and the uncertainty of future vaccine development. For a nation that struggles with a weak health care infrastructure and still faces preventable deaths from polio and diarrhea, managing the COVID-19 crisis has been a major challenge. The Khan administration’s blasé attitude came to light when Pakistan’s minister of health, Zafar Mirza, erroneously declared on Feb.  19, that the nation’s health care facilities were adequately resourced to tackle any outbreak, just as the pandemic was making its way around the world. At the time of writing, there are over 30,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in Pakistan with 667 reported deaths.  It’s clear that the preservation of national pride and the government’s reputation was the greater priority at the time. The skyrocketing of cases caused by the mishandling of pilgrims returning from Iran in mid-March revealed the complacency of the leadership.  The faulty testing of the pilgrims, who were kept in quarantine near the border with Iran, allowed them to return to their hometowns, where they spread the coronavirus.  Given that Pakistan shares borders with China, Iran, and India—three countries with a high number of reported cases—there was a dire need for effective cross-border cooperation and active health surveillance along the borders. 
When the lockdown came, implementation was delayed or piecemeal, exposing the government’s lack of swift decision-making.  Even after the application of strict social distancing guidelines, children and young adults—who can be an asymptomatic vector of transmission—continue to line the country’s streets playing cricket and socializing at roadside shops. Meanwhile, health care workers are refusing to come to work, condemning the lack of personal protective equipment provided by the government.  Many health care workers at public hospitals are reportedly paying out of pocket to procure protective gear for themselves, hospital cleaners, and security staff.  Without adequate testing and protective equipment, there has been a mass undercounting of cases, which has allowed for a faster spread of infections.

1,Pakistan Plans Another COVID-19 Lockdown. Will It Work?,"The government in Pakistan is considering the imposition of another countrywide lockdown if the COVID-19 situation continues to get worse. For Pakistan, flattening the curve and containing the virus’ spread by imposing a lockdown may have already become irrelevant. The utility of the lockdown was highest when the crisis was at an early stage and limited to Pakistan’s urban areas. With the virus’ spread now hitting all corners of the country and transmission patterns developing in rural areas, it is unclear if another lockdown is the solution or if it can be implemented at all. Pakistan’s hospitals are already operating above their capacity and turning away patients. Officially, the tally of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has surpassed 60,000. So far, more than 1,200 people have died all across Pakistan. During the last 24 hours alone, around 2,400 people affected by the COVID-19 were admitted to public hospitals or facilities created by the government. According to the latest figures, Pakistan only has around 4,000 ventilators, of which 2,200 are possessed by public sector hospitals. During the last two days, more than 150 people were put on the ventilators across the country. Pakistan faces a serious crisis when it comes to tracking the pandemic’s spread, and monitoring the severity of the situation. The actual story of the crisis is far worse than being reported. The cases emerging in the major urban areas are the key focus for the health officials. Arguably, it’s one of the reasons that cities like Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Islamabad have recorded more cases than other places. Smaller cities and adjacent towns across Pakistan, which are not the focus of the public health officials, neither have the capacity nor infrastructure in place to handle COVID-19 cases or record them correctly for the national or international audience. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current toll of fatalities from the COVID-19 cannot be gauged accurately in low or middle-income countries where only 30 percent of deaths take place in hospitals with known causes. This scenario is actually true for Pakistan as a growing number of people potentially dying from the virus only leave trails of breathing problems among their relatives and friends. On the other hand, in the country’s rural areas, no effort whatsoever is being made to either educate people of the virus’s threat or to test, track, and record cases. According to a WHO report published last week, COVID-19’s local transmission in Pakistan has risen to 80 percent. By lifting the lockdown, the government may have created an opening for the virus’ spread that may have been nonexistent before. For instance, there is still an ongoing debate about whether the virus’ spread has taken place in Pakistan’s rural areas. There is no data to back any claim as the government is not accurately recording cases from the country’s rural areas. However, one can argue that one week of the Eid holidays and the lifting of the lockdown that allowed millions of workers to travel back to their villages from major urban zones may have worsened the problem. There are real risks that these workers might have taken the virus back to their villages, setting up new clusters in regions that may have been previously safe. Going forward, it is unclear how the government plans to contain the virus’ spread when it couldn’t implement a clear policy during the early stages of the pandemic. The imposition of another lockdown is set to fail for several reasons. Pakistan has never implemented a complete lockdown in a true sense. In this regard, the scuffle between the center and the provinces continues to pose a challenge. Right-wing hardliners want to keep mosques open while small and major businesses have developed lobbies within the government to push for the opening of the economy. Pakistan’s ruling party remains a divided house on the matter too. The country’s social media is abuzz with posts from the government’s ministers pushing for the opening of businesses and others asking for a strict lockdown to contain the virus’s spread. Making the situation worse is the stressed capacity of the health care system, lack of training of the staff to record cases accurately, and the unavailability of the protective equipment. Reportedly, testing labs in Pakistan are operating under war conditions. The percentage of errors in collecting samples is very high. Recently, one of the largest testing facilities for coronavirus in Pakistan “received a batch of 800 samples from Bahawalpur in Punjab, of which only 261 could be processed. “The labels were wrong, the samples had leaked, the tags had rubbed off"". This affects our testing capacity and accuracy,” said a doctor working in the facility. The government has never communicated its policy firmly or with a clear-headed approach. Talk of another lockdown will not ease Pakistan’s troubles. In fact, it’s unlikely that people are going to follow the announcement of another lockdown as economic pressures reach boiling point. The best and perhaps the only time to effectively impose a strict lockdown was when the crisis was at the early stages and the government had a narrative to sell. From here onward, news of another lockdown with zero or no enforcement strategy will only create more problems. As the government loses control of the situation, it is COVID-19 that will decide the fate of millions of Pakistanis.",https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/pakistan-plans-another-covid-19-lockdown-will-it-work/
2,"COVID-19: Pakistan has a ‘dependency syndrome’, says Prime Minister Imran Khan","As Pakistan grapples to combat coronavirus with increasing number of cases, Prime Minister Imran Khan has urged the need to build its own reliable medical infrastructure.
“The coronavirus has brought to the fore that Pakistan needs to build its medical infrastructure and reduce dependency on foreign aid,” added Imran.
Speaking during this visit to COMSTECH exhibition in Islamabad on Wednesday, Prime Minister Imran said:“We have a dependency syndrome; we don’t have that self-belief, we didn’t progress towards knowledge economy because we didn’t spend on education and research. Pakistanis excel once they immigrate; why can’t you create that system here?”““We have to focus on building our medical infrastructure so that we are prepared for any such emergency situation in the future,”  he said and added that the COVID-19 crisis provided an opportunity to produce locally manufactured ventilators and protective equipment as everything cannot be imported. OMSTECH stands for the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation for the promotion and cooperation of science and technology activities among the OIC member states.
“It is only now — with a global shortage — that we have found out that building ventilators isn’t that hard. The country that had the capacity to make nuclear bombs, how hard can it be for it to make ventilators?” he said. “The biggest quality that takes a nation upwards is self-belief. This belief increases as the nation progresses and reaches a stage where the nation thinks it can overcome any challenge. The small island of Britain dominated the world. What did it have that was so special? It was self belief,” he noted Prime Minister Imran also congratulated Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry for seeing the potential in a dormant industry, reported Dawn news. Addressing the ceremony, Fawad Chaudhry said that one of Pakistan’s biggest mistakes was not linking military and civil research. “We have informally linked them now, defence and production industry,” Chaudhry said while adding that this has helped Pakistan produce equipment for battling coronavirus much faster. He said that NTRC and Nust have made disinfecting robots, drones can be used to disinfect areas under quarantine. “A thermal monitoring camera has been developed, will detect without touching,” Chaudhry said. He also praised the role of private sector in producing protective equipment for frontline workers. “We were facing a shortage of protective equipment in Pakistan a few weeks ago, now all of Faisalabad city is making protective suits for doctors and frontline workers. Now there is a need for us to consider how many of these we need, the rest we should export,” Chaudhry said. He further announced that Pakistan is now producing its own N-95 mask prototype. “While the masks being imported by Pakistan are costing Rs1,100, the ones we have created are going to cost Rs90 — a huge difference.” He also said that Pakistan took mere weeks to produce its own coronavirus testing kits.

We are looking for the commerce ministry to lift the ban on its export for us to be able to do that,” Chaudhry said. Meanwhile, the federal government is preparing to loosen coronavirus lockdown restrictions as the number of infections and deaths are “well below previous projections,” said Asad Umar, Minister of Planning. Pakistan despite registering more than 15,7500 cases of Covid-19 including 346 deaths has already granted exemptions to dozens of sectors to open up over the last few days. Umar said that infections and deaths in Pakistan were 30-35% lower than projections and, if things remained this way, the country could open up further in coming days. Experts say Pakistan’s low numbers are due to limited testing. Currently Pakistan, a country of more than 207 million people, conducts about 8,000 tests a day.

4,Donald Trump says he’s taking hydroxychloroquine to protect against COVID-19,"President Donald Trump said he’s taking antimalarial medication hydroxychloroquine and zinc because he believes the drugs could prevent COVID-19. “Here’s my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it,” he said today in a White House roundtable with restaurant executives. Trump said he’s been taking the drugs every day for a week and a half and that he has not had any COVID-19 symptoms. People close to the president, including one of Trump’s valets and Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, recently tested positive for the virus. There is still no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine can prevent someone from contracting or getting sick from the coronavirus. It’s a possibility — a number of research groups are running clinical trials to see if the drug could protect health care workers who are regularly exposed to the virus from getting sick — but no data from those studies is available yet. Trump said he’s following the lead of frontline workers. “You look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative,” he said. While there are clinical trials looking specifically at using the drug as a preventive for health care workers, it is still not clear how many health care workers are taking the drug. Side effects of hydroxychloroquine include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness. Trump spent weeks promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. His administration reportedly pushed the Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to authorize the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside of the hospital, based on meager evidence. While early data showed that hydroxychloroquine may help some patients, additional studies found that it wasn’t effective and could have dangerous side effects, especially in people with severe symptoms. Trump stopped touting the drug after that data was publicized. In April, the FDA warned against the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside the hospital or a clinical trial. While Trump says that he is taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc, that can’t be independently verified. All the public has is his word, and neither he nor his White House have been reliable sources of information during this pandemic. Among other things, Trump has spent the pandemic publicly recommending treatment strategies for COVID-19 based on limited evidence. In late April, he appeared to suggest that Lysol injections could cure the disease. No therapies have been proven to effectively treat or prevent COVID-19. At time of publication, more than 90,000 people in the United States have died of the disease.

5,Trump addresses military cadets amid Pentagon tensions,"President Donald Trump has told graduates of the country's top military academy that the US forces are ""not the policeman of the world"" days after threatening to deploy active troops to quell protests across the country sparked by the police killing of an unarmed Black man. Speaking to new graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point on Saturday, Trump praised the ""righteous glory of the American warrior"" but largely side-stepped the recent controversies of racial unrest and the military's role in putting down the nationwide protests that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minnesota after a white officer kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes. What has made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment. When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal,"" Trump said, in one of the few apparent references to the domestic situation.
Trump, who has faced bipartisan criticism in recent days for a reported plan to withdraw 9,500 US troops from Germany, one of the country's strong allies, instead focused on his ""America First"" message, his main campaign platform ahead of the November presidential election. The president told the more than 1,000 graduating cadets, arrayed in a social-distancing pattern as a coronavirus precaution, that the job of the American soldier is not to rebuild foreign nations but ""defend, and defend strongly, our nation from foreign enemies"". ""We are ending the era of endless wars,"" Trump said, adding American forces should not be expected ""to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have not even heard of"". Trump's speech came as tensions between the White House and the military remain high over the president's handling of the protests. The discord includes the public denouncement by Defense Secretary Mark Esper of the president's threat to use active-duty troops to intervene, some of which were amassed on the outskirts of Washington, DC as the unrest grew. During the address, Trump also thanked the National Guard, whose response to the demonstrations in the US capital is currently under review by the defence department, for ""ensuring peace, safety and the constitutional rule of law on our streets"". Critics have accused the president of leaning too heavily on the reserve forces, who have in turn been accused of overly-aggressive tactics during demonstrations in the US capital.
In one instance, the National Guard, along with park police, cleared an area near the White House of protesters, using smoke bombs and pepper balls to disperse the mostly peaceful gathering. Minutes later, Trump and several high-ranking officials walked through the area for a photo op at a nearby church. On Thursday, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said he regretted his presence at Trump's side during the June 1 incident. ""I should not have been there,"" said Milley, adding that his presence ""created a perception of military involvement in domestic politics"". In an open letter published this week, more than 500 West Point graduates called on the Class of 2020 to honour their commitment to avoid partisan politics.
